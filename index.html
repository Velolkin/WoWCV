  <p>I have played World of Warcraft on and off over the past decade through its various expansions, but have played Battle for Azeroth significantly more than any previous iteration. Throughout BFA, I have enjoyed playing a number of max level
    characters, but have recently switched my main to a Mag'Har Orc Warrior of the Frostwolf Clan named Greggore. In the 8.1 patch, being the first time I had opted to take on the 'tanking' role, I focused on learning the ins-and-outs of a Protection
    Paladin. However, when I unlocked the ability to create a Mag-Har race character, I quickly created a new warrior and loved the intense and fast-flowing gameplay it entails. Since then, I have been leaping and charging my way through the 8.3
    patch and like all heros, I have been trying to rid the world of its evil corruption.</p>

  <h3>Characters</h3>
  <p>There are so many classes and races available in WoW that it's hard to decide on just one! Since the launch of the 8.1 expansion, I've nearly played them all. From melee to ranged, heals to tank, there's been so much to experience that it's hard
    to chose just one to focus on.Currently, I'm really enjoying playing my Death Knight and Warrior.</p>
  <p>If you want to see more, I've included a link to all of my max level Battle for Azeroth characters <a href="characters.html">here</a>.</p>

  <h3>Battle for Azeroth</h3>
  <p><a href="https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/">World of Warcraft</a> has been a hugely popular game since its first release back in November 2004. In this time, they've released numerous expansions with an increidble amount of content.
    Unfortunately for myself, I've only had the opportunity to play a few of these, with the latest expansion,titled "Battle for Azeroth (BFA)", being the one have played most. </p>
  <p>In BFA, I had played a number of different roles and characters, but mainly played my Protection Paladin in the first 8.1 patch and my Fury Warrior in the latest 8.3 patch. I've included a list of the various roles/classes/specs I've played in
    BFA below.</p>
